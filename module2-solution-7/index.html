 		<span id="nr1">FILM CRITIC</span>
 		 <p> Critiquing movies was a fascination I had when I was a kid, and because of this, Roger Ebert's film reviews, and Rotten Tomatoes, I have aspired to be a film critic when I grew up. However I gave up that dream after I realized that my salary for that job would be pretty low and unsustainable. </p>

 	 		<p> Bringing dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals back to the 21st Century was a major dream I had as a kid. But then I realized the TRUE reason as to why no one has ever actually done this yet, or even DARED TO. Going back to in time and bringing back a dinosaur back to our time could possibly throw our timeline off the whack. And if by some chance that this didn't happen, there's no way I could possibly afford the money to run or pay for the hypothetical prehistoric park the dinosaurs would be in. </p>

     		<span id="nr3">FILMMAKER</span>
     		<p> Filmmaking was something I was interested in for a while now, as I throughout the last few years, I have came up with some pitches for movies for Marvel, DC, WB, Disney, after watching their films. I also wanted to be a film editor as well, as the idea of reviewing and correcting film scripts interested me. But over time, I grew less and less interested in this job field until it became a dream I wasn't persuing any longer. </p>
